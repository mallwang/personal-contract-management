**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The spec documents 11 user stories covering: sidebar navigation (segmented, admin-only second segment), settings panel (language picker + theme toggle), sign-out/account access, dashboard stats widget, sortable contract table, contract form inputs, anonymization controls, password strength input, user management table, sign-in page layout, and application footer. All pre-decided Mantine UI component choices are captured in Assumptions. No clarification markers remain.
